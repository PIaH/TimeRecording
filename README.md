TimeRecording is a small tool for recording your work time.
It is meant to be used while working in several parallel projects.
You can easily switch between activities and just hit "Start" and "Stop".
Your time is tracked automatically and you can create an export to Excel or in plaintext format.
The time on projects is summurized, so that you can check if you are still within your budget or not.
